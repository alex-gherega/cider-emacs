# Clo<i>j</i>ure env setup

## What you get

Configs and dependencies for Emacs to integrate Cider plugin and related Clojure edit utilities such as:

* ElDoc mode
* Clojure mode
* Syntax highlight
* Parenthesis automation - Paredit
* Autocompletion plugin
* Rainbow parenthesis delimiters
* Parenthesis matching
* Zenburn theme
* M-TAB or C-M-i to manual trigger autocomplete

A how-to guide to get you started with a basic Clojure development environment using:
* [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
* [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/)

## Notations & definitions

Parentheses are used below to denote important steps (and to make you more comfortable with Lisp like sintax)

$NAME denotes a system variable called NAME; I'll refer to your basic home directory (e.g. /home/alex/) by $HOME sys variable.

## System requirements

__You'll need:__

a. UNIX/Linux environment
<dl>
	<dd>(virtual-machine with Ubuntu 14.04 or newer)</dd>
	<dd>(tested with Ubuntu 14.04 & Ubuntu 15.04)</dd>
	<dd>(have your Wi-Fi working on the VM)</dd>
</dl>

b. Java 1.8 installed and visible in your $PATH

c. Emacs 24.4.1 [tested] or higher installed

## Dev env setup: a guide

### Leinigen

The project automation tool

&emsp; (have the following script downloaded: [lein](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein))

&emsp; (place it on your $PATH where your shell cand find it)

&emsp;  (set it to be executable (`chmod a+x /path/to/your/lein-download-dir/lein)`)

&emsp;  (run it `lein` and it will download the self-install package)

&emsp; (after that run `lein upgrade` to get the latest stuff in)

### Emacs

__note:__ for a quick-extremely-basic-hands-on Emacs editting [go here](http://ocean.stanford.edu/research/quick_emacs.html)




__plug'n'play setup (the easy way):__

&emsp; a. (clone [this](https://github.com/alex-gherega/clojure-env-setup) git repo `git clone https://github.com/alex-gherega/clojure-env-setup` into some $DIR

&emsp; b. then copy $DIR/clojure-env-setup/.emacs.d/ directory into your $HOME/ directory

&emsp; (you'll need to remove/ovewrite the old $HOME/emacs.d/ directory)



__manual setup (the hadrcore way):__

&emsp; a. After installing emacs start it and run: M-x package-refresh-contents

&emsp; b. Add an init.el file to your $HOME/.emacs/ directory

&emsp; c. Emacs ElDoc mode:

&emsp;&emsp; (install eldoc mode [follow this recipe] (https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ElDoc#toc2))</p>

&emsp; d. Clojure plugins [required]
  
&emsp; &emsp; (Emacs CIDER plug-in [follow this recipe](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/blob/master/README.md))

&emsp; &emsp; (Clojure REPL plug-in (you're done! comes inside CIDER plug-in))

&emsp; &emsp; (Emacs clojure-mode [follow this recipe](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clojure-mode/blob/master/README.md))
  
  
&emsp; e. Clojure plugins [not required but helpful]

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; (Syntax highlight plug-in (you're done! Comes inside CIDER plug-in + Clojure mode))<p>
    
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; (Parenthesis automation

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; + (install Paredit [follow this recipe]())

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; + (add the following `(add-hook 'cider-repl-mode-hook #'paredit-mode)` to your init.el file))
		
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; (Auto-completion plug-in [folow this recipe](http://cider.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_completion/))

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; (Close parenthesis delimieters & match:

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  + ([follow this recipe](https://github.com/Fanael/rainbow-delimiters/blob/master/README.md))

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  + (add these 2 lines to your init.el file)

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; `(add-hook 'cider-repl-mode-ook #'rainbow-delimiters-mode)`

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; `(add-hook 'cider-mode-hook #'rainbow-delimiters-mode)`

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; + (add `(show-paren-mode 1)` to your init.el file))
		
## Test it out!

a. ```git clone https://github.com/alex-gherega/prisoners-dilema``` into some $DIR

b. cd $DIR/

c. start emacs: ```emacs &```

d. once emacs has started hit C-F11 (hold Ctrl and press F11)

![alt text](https://github.com/alex-gherega/clojure-env-setup/elstart.png "")

e. after a minute or so you should see this:

![alt text](https://github.com/alex-gherega/clojure-env-setup/elcljrepl.png "")

f. now open the project file src/torunament.clj

g. you should see the code highlighted; hitting C-c C-k (hold Ctrl and press c then k) should compile your code; tryout matching and highlighting matchign parans;

h. your done! cheers :)
